    "### Attack\n",
    "Well, I may be a nihlist but this particular workshop does have a solution. There's one last SQL concept I need to introduce, the `SLEEP` statement. This can be inserted in an ordinary query like so:\n",
    "```MySQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE password LIKE BINARY \"pass%\" AND SLEEP(1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you're familiar with how `if` statements are evaluated in language like C and python, you may see where I'm going with this. SQL uses what's called short-circuit evaluation: if it can find the answer to a conditional statement early on, it doesn't bother checking the rest of the statement. For example, in the following statement:\n",
    "```MySQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=\"bob\" AND password=\"bobspassword\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there isn't any user named bob, MySQL won't bother looking at passwords; it already knows the query won't return anything, so it stops. The same applies to this statement:\n",
    "```MySQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=\"bob\" AND SLEEP(1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "It may seem weird that we're putting a delay in a conditional statement, but this works the same as the above. If there's no user named bob, SQL will short circuit the query and there will be no delay. If there is a user named bob, SQL won't short circuit and there will be a 1 second delay. I've put the python code below: you should stop here before looking at it and think about how we can use this behavior to do the same thing we did in part two."
