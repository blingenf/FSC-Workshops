## Workshop 1 Solutions
These solutions are all in the form of Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks are designed to be downloaded and run in the FSC lab, but you can also read through them at home. If you have issues viewing the notebooks in Github, you can use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

To run a notebook in the lab, I recommend installing [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). You can do this as a normal user in the lab, and it will persist regardless of which computer you log into. After installing anaconda, you can run `jupyter notebook` in a terminal and open the notebooks through the jupyter web interface.
