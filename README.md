# FSC-Workshops
Materials designed for workshops hosted at the FSC Lab. Source code for the workshop exercises and their associated solutions will go up one to two weeks after the workshop takes place.

Infrastructure for the scoreboard/flag capturing system is in the CTF Infrastructure folder (currently not available, it's being updated and had a security issue anyway).
