    "It's important to remember when doing log parsing that logs are structured data. That's good news; structured data can be easily captured by patterns which allow us to restructure the data however we want. Trying to understand a log using ad-hoc scripts for each task may work in the short term, but if you need to understand anything remotely advanced it'll end up biting you in the back. Let's look at how to do things better:"

In order to find log messages that don't follow that structure, I'm going to write a regular expression to capture the structure I've seen and then see what shows up in the log not following that structure. The important thing here is to capture all the variation I've seen with as few repeat symbols (+ and *, in particular) in the regular expression as possible. This avoids accidentally capturing log events that don't follow the structure I've seen (which, for now, we don't want to do)\n",
